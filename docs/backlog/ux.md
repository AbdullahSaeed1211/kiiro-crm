# UX backlog

7 findings are open: 1 critical, 2 major and 4 minor. They come from a review of the product UI at commit `cc6b2d6`, run through the Acme Agency tenant in Chromium at 1440px and 390px and compared against the reference products in `../references/`. The atomic reference-parity inventory stays in [the reference-parity backlog](../ux/reference-parity-backlog.md); this file lists what the review found, with a fix for each.

Critical means a core workflow is broken or a staff user hits it on day one. "Quick" is about a day or less; "Structural" needs a new shared component or data model. Codes such as T-01 or R-03 group related symptoms: T tasks, B boards and calendar, R records, S shell. Numbers are stable identifiers, so gaps mean a finding was fixed. Delete a finding in the commit that fixes it.

Reference files are cited to show observed behavior. Copy code only from MIT or Apache-2.0 sources, as [AGENTS.md](../../AGENTS.md#references-and-licences) describes; re-implement the rest.

## Critical

### 3. The E2E suite can't see broken layouts

- Area: Tests. Effort: Quick.
- Now: `route-health.spec.ts:351-356` checks that an "Assignees" heading is visible and that `[data-slot="sheet-content"]` has no matches. The broken page passes both. It saves a screenshot, but nothing ever compares it. Most routes get only a "heading is visible" check.
- Fix: Add `toHaveScreenshot` diffs for the core surfaces, and geometry checks: the content box must not intersect the header, and a standalone route must have no Close button. The file already uses bounding boxes and layout-shift checks for the panel, so this reuses a known technique.
- Status: partly fixed. A geometry check now asserts the standalone task page does not overlap the app header and has no Close button; it fails until the page gets its own layout. `layout-shift.spec.ts` now watches nine routes at two widths for layout shift. Screenshot diffs are not added yet.

## Major

## Minor

### 34. Closing a task panel on phones loses focus

- Area: Tasks. Effort: Quick. Codes: A-04.
- In mobile WebKit (390px), pressing Escape on a task panel opened from `/calendar` returns to the calendar, but the task link is not focused; desktop Chromium focuses it. `app-frame.tsx` focuses `[data-task-link-id]` on the pathname change, and something focuses after it. Found by `route-health.spec.ts` "task details preserve origin", which fails on the mobile project at `v0.2.0`.
- Status: fix applied, not yet verified in WebKit. Safari does not focus a tapped link, so the dialog's default focus return lands on the page body after our effect. `TaskSheet` now passes `finalFocus` to focus the task's visible link directly. Chromium passes with and without the fix; WebKit could not be downloaded in the sandbox. Run the mobile project to close this.
